Multi-Element Sum Finder
A C++ implementation that finds combinations of multiple elements in an array that sum to a target value.

Description
This algorithm efficiently finds all unique combinations of a specified number of elements from an array that sum to a given target value. 
It uses a combination of backtracking and a two-pointer approach to optimize the search process.

Features
- Finds all unique combinations of `m` elements that sum to a target value
- Avoids duplicate combinations through sorting and skipping
- Uses a specialized two-pointer technique for the case of finding pairs (m=2)
- Handles both positive and negative numbers

Function Documentation

findCombinations(vector<int>& nums, int i, int m, vector<int>& ans, int sum, int target)

Parameters:
- `nums`: Input array of integers (should be sorted)
- `i`: Starting index for the current recursion
- `m`: Number of elements to include in each combination
- `ans`: Vector to store the current combination being built
- `sum`: Running sum of the current combination
- `target`: Target sum to achieve

Implementation details:
- Uses backtracking to find combinations with more than 2 elements
- Implements a two-pointer approach for the special case of m=2
- Skips duplicate combinations by avoiding repeated elements

Time Complexity
- Sorting: O(n log n)
- Finding combinations: O(n^m) in the worst case
- Two-pointer optimization for pairs: O(n^2)

Applications
- Subset sum problems
- Combination problems in algorithms
- Financial applications (finding combinations of transactions that sum to a specific amount)
- Data analysis and pattern recognition
